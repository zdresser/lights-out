# Lights Out

This is my take on the 90's game [Lights Out](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)>). The board loads with a random assortment of lights turned on, and the player's objective is to turn off all the lights. The trick is that each click toggles neighboring lights, too.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
